# 🏠 Heritage Housing Price Estimator

This Streamlit-based web app is being developed as part of a Diploma in Full Stack Software Development final project. It is a predictive analytics tool designed to estimate house prices in Ames, Iowa, using a dataset sourced from a public Kaggle repository.

---

## 📌 Project Purpose

The aim of this project is to assist users — such as homeowners, property investors, or analysts — in understanding which features most strongly influence house prices in Ames, Iowa, and to provide a predicted sale price based on specific property attributes.

The app will:
- Deliver data-driven insights using machine learning
- Allow users to input house features and receive price predictions
- Present intuitive dashboards for exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## 📊 Completed Tasks (So Far)

### ✅ Data Upload

The following datasets have been collected and stored in the `data/` folder:

- `house_prices_records.csv`: Core dataset from Ames, Iowa

- `inherited_houses.csv`: A smaller test set for prediction purposes

- `house-metadata.txt`: Supporting documentation for variables

### ✅ Data Exploration

In `01_data_exploration.ipynb`, the following have been completed:

- Dataset shape and summary statistics

- Identification of missing values

- Count of duplicate records

- Initial visualizations of key outliers (`SalePrice`, `GrLivArea`, `LotArea`)

### ✅ Data Cleaning

In `02_data_cleaning.ipynb`, the following cleaning steps were completed:

- **Duplicates removed** to prevent bias in modeling
- **Columns with >30% missing data** were dropped to simplify handling
- **Numerical columns** had missing values filled with the **median**
- **Categorical columns** had missing values filled with the **mode**
- The `SalePrice` column was **log-transformed** to reduce skewness in the target variable
- The cleaned dataset was saved as `house_prices_cleaned.csv` in the `data/` folder

### ✅ Feature Engineering

In `03_feature_engineering.ipynb`, the following preprocessing tasks were completed:

- Loaded the cleaned dataset
- Applied **One-Hot Encoding** to all categorical features using `pd.get_dummies()`
- Dropped the original `SalePrice` column (we will use the log-transformed version for modeling)
- Saved the fully preprocessed dataset as `house_prices_preprocessed.csv` in the `data/` folder

### ✅ Modeling & Evaluation

In `04_model_training.ipynb`, a Linear Regression model was trained to predict house sale prices using the log-transformed `SalePrice_log` as the target. Key steps:

-   Selected six predictive features:\
    `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`, `GarageArea`, `YearBuilt`, `TotalBsmtSF`, `LotArea`

-   Built a `scikit-learn` pipeline to handle missing values and fit the model

-   Split the data into **training and test sets**

-   Evaluated the model performance:

    -   **R² Score:** *0.842*

    -   **RMSE:** *0.172*

-   Plotted **actual vs. predicted** values for test set to validate predictions

-   Saved the trained pipeline as `linreg_model.joblib` in the

### ✅ Streamlit Interface: Project Summary Page

- Implemented the `MultiPage` helper class to enable sidebar navigation between different app pages
- Created `page_project_summary.py` to serve as the landing page for the Streamlit app
- The summary page outlines the project goals, objectives, and tools used
- Registered the page inside `streamlit_app.py` for streamlined navigation

### ✅ Streamlit Interface: Data Insights Page

- Created `page_data_visuals.py` to present key exploratory data visualisations
- Added three key plots to explore correlation with house prices:
  - **Scatter plot** of `SalePrice` vs `GrLivArea` (Above-Ground Living Area)
  - **Box plot** of `SalePrice` vs `OverallQual` (Overall House Quality)
  - **Heatmap** of top 10 numeric features most correlated with `SalePrice`
- Registered the page in `streamlit_app.py` for sidebar navigation
- Highlighted strong predictors such as `GrLivArea`, `OverallQual`, and `GarageArea`


### ✅ Streamlit Interface: Predict House Price Page

- Added a page titled **"Predict House Price"** to the Streamlit app using the `MultiPage` system.
- This page allows users to input specific house attributes such as:
  - Overall Quality
  - Above-Ground Living Area
  - Garage Area
  - Year Built
  - Total Basement Area
  - Lot Area
- When the form is submitted, the app uses the trained Linear Regression model to predict the house price.
- The model predicts a log-transformed sale price, which is then converted back to dollars using `np.expm1()`.
- Displays the result in an easy-to-read format such as:  
  `💰 Estimated Sale Price: $217,000`

## 📅 Next Steps (Planned)

- Deploy model into the Streamlit app
